The plot I decided to improve is figure 1 from [Shorter birth intervals between siblings are associated with increased risk of parental divorce](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6993964/):

The problem here is unreadability because of using different line style instead of different colors.

### 1. Generating Data

```{r}

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

In the article there were not full details given. There were only given endpoints in 10 years for interbirth intervals \<1.5 years and \>4 years. Therefore I generated data using these information.

Firstly, I assigned endpoints for each IBI group based on given data. Then I defined a logistic growth function to simulate cumulative divorce risk over time. 'k' is the steepness, 'midpoint' is the inflection point.

```{r}
end_values <- c(
  `< 1.5 years` = 0.26,
  `1.5–2 years` = 0.22,
  `2–3 years` = 0.20,
  `3–4 years` = 0.19,
  `More than 4 years` = 0.18
)


logistic_curve <- function(time, max_val, k = 0.5, midpoint = 5) {
  max_val / (1 + exp(-k * (time - midpoint)))
}
```

Then based of that I generated data. I used expand_grid() to generate all combinations of 'Years' x 'IBI', and than calculated Divorce Rate for each combination.

```{r}
data <- expand_grid(
  Years = seq(0, 10, by = 0.1),
  IBI = factor(names(end_values))
) %>%
  mutate(DivorceRate = logistic_curve(Years, max_val = end_values[IBI]))
```

### 2. Making a plot

I generated line plot with 'Years' on x axis and 'DivorceRate'\*100 on y axis to obtain percentage value. I grouped data by IBI and labeled it by different colors.

I used minimal theme and made some adjustment like centering the title and moving legend below the plot fo aesthetic.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Years, y = DivorceRate*100, color = IBI)) +
  geom_line(size=1) +
  labs(
    title = "Cumulative risk of divorce by interbirth interval categories",
    x = "Years since second child birth",
    y = "Percentage divorced"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), 
    legend.position = "bottom",
    )
```
